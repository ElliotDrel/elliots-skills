# Adding a Skill to E-Stack

Follow these steps in order. Do not manually bump `package.json` version.

## 1. Create the skill folder

```
skills/estack-<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

The folder MUST be prefixed with `estack-`. The `SKILL.md` needs frontmatter with the name ALSO prefixed with `estack-`:

```markdown
---
name: estack-<skill-name>
description: (<skill-name>) <one-line description — this shows up in the skill list>
---
```

Both the folder and the `name` field use the `estack-` prefix. The `description` MUST start with `(<skill-name>)` (the short name without the prefix). This namespaces the skill correctly when installed to `~/.claude/skills/`.

Add any supporting files (references, steps, scripts) in subfolders as needed.

## 2. Show the diff (if migrating from an existing skill)

If the skill already exists somewhere (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`), diff it:

```bash
diff -ru ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name> skills/estack-<skill-name>
```

Show the output and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

## 3. Delete the old copy (if migrating)

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/<old-skill-name>
```

## 4. Run the installer

```bash
node bin/install.cjs
```

This copies all skills from `skills/` to `~/.claude/skills/`. Confirm the new skill appears in the output.

## 5. Confirm with the user before committing

NEVER commit or push without explicit confirmation from the user. Before touching git:

1. Show the user a summary of all files that will be committed
2. Show the proposed commit message
3. Remind them that `[publish]` in the message triggers an npm publish
4. Ask for explicit confirmation (e.g. "Ready to commit and push?")
5. Only proceed after the user says yes

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
git add skills/estack-<skill-name>/
git commit -m "add <skill-name> skill [publish]"
git push
```

Do NOT manually bump `package.json` version — the GitHub Actions workflow handles it automatically.

## 6. Route to publish (optional)

If the commit included `[publish]`, follow `steps/publish.md` Phase 3 to verify the publish landed.
