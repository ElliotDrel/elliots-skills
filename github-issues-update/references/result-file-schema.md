## Frontmatter

```yaml

state: open
state_changed: false           # true if state changed since last check

```

### Role Field

The role MUST describe what the user **did**, not just a label.

Bad: `"Author"`, `"Commenter"`
Good: `"Author (filed with 3 crash instances, posted workaround)"`,
`"Commenter (confirmed bug + shared exact callbackPort: 3118 fix)"`

## Body Sections

### ## Summary

Plain English: where does this issue stand and why does it matter? Write as if briefing
someone who hasn't looked at the issue in a week. Include dates, names, numbers.

Bad: "Issue is about a bug that causes crashes."
Good: "You filed this on Jan 15 about a crash when renaming MCP servers. Root cause is
tracked upstream in bun#28175. Workaround: name servers differently."

### ## Activity

What happened since last check (or full history if first analysis).

Format:
```
- @username (YYYY-MM-DD): What they said WITH specifics.
```

### ## Duplicates and Related

Two subsections:

#### ### Known — updates
Status changes on previously known duplicates/adjacent issues. Or "No changes."

#### ### New finds
Newly discovered duplicates or related issues. Or "None found."

For each entry, explain whether it shares a **root cause** (duplicate) or just
**symptoms** (adjacent). Don't just list titles — explain WHY it's related.

Bad: `"#40693 — related rename issue"`
Good: `"#40693 — VS Code UI blocking during rename. Same symptom (rename fails) but
different root cause: UI thread blocking vs JSONL write. Adjacent, not duplicate."`

### ## Next Steps

Specific, actionable items. This shows up in the report as what the user should do.

Bad: `"Monitor for updates"`, `"Follow up"`
Good: `"Respond to @maintainer's request for memory profiling data"`,
`"Test fix in PR #4521 against your reproduction case"`,
`"Nothing to do — waiting on maintainer review. Check back next week."`

### ## Key Context

Workarounds (exact commands, not paraphrases), severity signals, technical details
someone would need to discuss this issue knowledgeably.

Bad: `"Use different server names"`
Good: `"Workaround: set MIMALLOC_ARENA_EAGER_COMMIT=0 before starting. Reduces peak
RSS from 2.4GB to 1.1GB but doesn't eliminate growth."`

### ## Tracker Updates

Machine-readable lines consumed by `update-tracker` and `build-tracker`:

```
status_summary: Open. Labels: bug, p1. JSONL crash on rename. 12 comments total.
what_to_check: PRs modifying renameSession; JSONL title write logic changes.
```

Optional:
```
new_duplicate: #NUMBER — @author, "Title" (date). Why related. [duplicate|adjacent]
```

History entries (one per notable event):
```
history_entry: YYYY-MM-DD | Description of action or event
```

What to log: actions taken ("Posted comment"), external events ("Maintainer replied"),
state changes ("Closed via PR #123"). Don't log "no activity" — only real events.
