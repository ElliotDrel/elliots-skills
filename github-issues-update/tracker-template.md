## Morning Check-In Procedure

Run this to get a quick status update on all active issues:

```bash
gh api search/issues?q=involves:USERNAME_HERE+updated:>$(python3 -c "import datetime; print((datetime.datetime.now()-datetime.timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))")+is:open --jq '.items[] | "#\(.number) \(.repository_url | split("/") | .[-2:] | join("/")) — \(.title) [updated: \(.updated_at)]"'
```

Then for each issue, check recent comments:
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --jq '.[-3:] | .[] | "[\(.created_at)] @\(.user.login): \(.body[0:200])"'
```
